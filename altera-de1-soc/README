Step 1]
	It looks like I can open a server with this command (inside of a nios shell):
	./openocd -f ../share/openocd/scripts/interface/altera-usb-blaster2.cfg -f ../share/openocd/scripts/target/altera_fpgasoc.cfg

	However, when I try to connect following these commands:
	arm-altera-eabi-gdb ...
	(gdb) target remote localhost:3333

	the server connection closes and I get:
	Error: JTAG-DP OVERRUN - check clock, memaccess, or reduce jtag speed

	=====================================================================
	How did I try to solve the problem:

	* modified the target script (see altera_fpgasoc.txt), so that 
	the FPGA matches the same id seen when I run jtagconfig command 
	(0x02d120dd)

	* the Error appears following one of the following lines:
	jtag newtap $_CHIPNAME.fpga tap -irlen 10 -ircapture 0x01 -irmask 0x3 -expected-id $_FPGA_TAPID
	target create $_TARGETNAME1 cortex_a -chain-position $_CHIPNAME.dap -coreid 0 -dbgbase 0x80110000	

	Seems related to USB Blaster II not supported... 
	Try to run with -d flag!

	* if I use a classic USB Blaster on the jtag header (as suggested 
	on the web) it does not show errors, but it hangs as described 
	in this post:
	http://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/mailman/message/32694923/

	WAIT FOR USB BLASTER II SUPPORT... at the moment it seems not easy to overcome the problem
