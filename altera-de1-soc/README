Step 1]
	It looks like I can open a server with this command (inside of a nios shell):
	./openocd -f ../share/openocd/scripts/interface/altera-usb-blaster2.cfg -f ../share/openocd/scripts/target/altera_fpgasoc.cfg

	However, when I try to connect following these commands:
	arm-altera-eabi-gdb ...
	(gdb) target remote localhost:3333

	the server connection closes and I get:
	Error: JTAG-DP OVERRUN - check clock, memaccess, or reduce jtag speed

	TRY WITH NEW VERSION FROM REPO? OR CHECK THE .cfg SCRIPTS!
